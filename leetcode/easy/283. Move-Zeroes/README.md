## 문제

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

## example 1

```code
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

## example 2

```code
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- 2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
