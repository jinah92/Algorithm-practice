## 문제

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## example 1

```code
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

## example 2

```code
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

## constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
